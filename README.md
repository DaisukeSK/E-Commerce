# Welcome to E-Commerce App!

This is a sample e-commerce app made with<br/>
[`React.JS`](https://react.dev/) + [`TypeScript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for front-end,<br/>
[`Node.JS`](https://nodejs.org/) + [`PostgreSQL`](https://www.postgresql.org/) for back-end<br/>
and also multiple fake-shop APIs.<br/>

## Run the Project

Go to `frontend` directory, and run

```
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:5173) in your browser to view it.

## Project Description

This is a sample e-commerce app with basic functionalities of EC websites such as

- creating a user account
- searching products
- adding to shopping-cart
- adding to favorite
- purchase
- referring purchase history

and so on.

If you don't feel like creating your own user account, please use the below shared account.

- username: `guest`
- password: `123456`

I'm afraid it may sometimes take some time up to 1 minute to access database since it is using free database.
