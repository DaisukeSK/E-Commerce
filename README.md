Welcome to E-commerce app!<br/>

This is a sample e-commerce app made width<br/>
<b>React.js + TypeScript</b> for front-end,<br/>
<b>Node.js + PostgreSQL</b> for back-end<br/>
and also multiple fake-shop APIs.<br/>

This app has basic functionalities of EC websites such as<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;creating a user account,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;searching products,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;adding to shopping-cart,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;adding to favorite,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;purchase,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;referring purchase history<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and so on.<br/>

If you don't feel like creating your own user account, please use the below shared account.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;username: sample<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;password: 1234<br/>

I'm afraid it may sometimes take some time up to 1 minute to access database since it is using free database.
