Welcome to E-commerce app!<br/>

This is a sample e-commerce app made width<br/>
<b><u>React.js + TypeScript</u></b> for front-end,<br/>
<b><u>Node.js + PostgreSQL</u></b> for back-end<br/>
and also multiple fake-shop APIs.<br/>

This app has basic functionalities of EC websites such as<br/>

&nbsp;creating a user account,<br/>
&nbsp;searching products,<br/>
&nbsp;adding to shopping-cart,<br/>
&nbsp;adding to favorite,<br/>
&nbsp;purchase,<br/>
&nbsp;referring purchase history<br/>
&nbsp;and so on.<br/>

If you don't feel like creating your own user account, please use this shared account.<br/>
&nbsp;<u>username: sample</u><br/>
&nbsp;<u>password: 1234</u><br/>

I'm afraid it may sometimes take some time up to 1 minute to access database since it is using free database.
