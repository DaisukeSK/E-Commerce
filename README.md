## Project Description

This is a sample e-commerce app width basic functionalities of EC websites such as<br/>

- creating a user account
- searching products
- adding to shopping-cart
- adding to favorite
- purchase
- referring purchase history

  and so on.

If you don't feel like creating your own user account, please use the below shared account.<br/>

- username: `guest`<br/>
- password: `123456`<br/>

I'm afraid it may sometimes take some time up to 1 minute to access database since it is using free database.
